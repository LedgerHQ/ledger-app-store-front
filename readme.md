# Ledger App Store Front

## Features

React Silicon Life comes preconfigured with some pretty ðŸ˜Ž features:
  - [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), you know, state management
  - [React Router 4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router), because we need routing
  - [Styled JXS](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx) for CSS styling
  - [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) to make sure we follow the same coding style
  - [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) so be **really** sure we follow the same coding style
  - [Flow](https://flow.org) to make you believe Javascript is a typed language
  - [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest) for tests, also because it's good now (not kidding)
  - [Babel](https://babeljs.io) with ES20xx features (think _async/await_ and stuff)
  - [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), because **bundling** and **hot reloading**, setup with webpack dev server
  
## How To Use

### ðŸ›  Prerequisite

You will need `node >= 8` and `npm >= 3`, or `yarn` if you like yarn

### ðŸ”§ Install
Clone or fork the project and install dependencies
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:valpinkman/react-silicon-life.git
$ cd react-silicon-life
$ npm i 
# or if you use yarn
$ yarn
```

### ðŸŽ‰ Start the project and get coding

NPM start script will spawn a webpack-dev-server to https://localhost:9000

```bash
$ npm start
```

Then you can start editing the App however you see fit. If you don't like the folder architecture, please feel free to change it at your _gusto_.

### âœ… Testing

Testing is done using Jest. Start the tests by running `npm test`. Jest will generate _snapshots_ that will be used when you run test again, and alert you if anything has changed. If you need to update your snapshots, simply run the command `npm run test-update`

### ðŸ‘¾ Extra VSCode Setup

If you need help configuring all the tools talked about here (flow, eslint, prettier...) with VS Code, here is a really helpful article on Hackernoon: [Configure ESLint, Prettier, and Flow in VS Code for React Development](https://hackernoon.com/configure-eslint-prettier-and-flow-in-vs-code-for-react-development-c9d95db07213)

Also here is my VS Code workspace setting if that can help: [gist](https://gist.github.com/valpinkman/84f48cb00a1c36d543747efc56111e4d)
