## Development

To make sure this project works, you will need to run the [App Store Api](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-store-api) (check out the repo for informations on how to setup django superusers and database)

Once you have both setup and running, you can then start this project

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-store-front
$ cd ledger-app-store-front
$ yarn # or $ npm install
$ yarn start # or $ npm start
```

Then navigate to `https://localhost:9000/` and start coding ðŸ™‚
